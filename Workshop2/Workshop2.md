# Workshop 2
## Goals
The workshop hopes to serve as an introduction to the basics of Classes and Modules in Python. We'll cover how to create classes and modules and use them to recreate the tamagotchi code toy we created in the previous workshop. 

The end product of this workshop will be a recreated version of last workshops code toy but using modular code that can be reused.
