# Workshop 3
## Goals
Workshop 3 aims to take all the basics we covered in workshop 1 and workshop 2 and start applying them to some Data science applications. In this workshop we'll also cover numpy and matplot as some of the more task focused python libraries when it comes to datascience. 

The end goal of this workshop is to serve as an introduction to some of the expansion libraries to python as well as how they work. We'll also cover some performance debugging tools and talk about how to approach writing a application with performance in mind.
