# Workshop 5
## Goals
In Workshop 5 datavisualisation is the focus.

We'll specifically look at visualizing some data using the data processing and storage processes we've looked at sofar. 
We'll be using matplotlib and pyplot.

This will be the first workshop with a post workshop submission.

## Git Setup

Git is a tool used for mananging and tracking changes to a code base.

Git works with a series of commits that is effectively marking a set of changes with a timestamp and a name.

For the submission part of this workshop you'll need a [Github](https://github.com/) account. 

I recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as a way to simplify managing your git experience.

## MatPlotLib

MatPlotLib is a module for python that is designed to draw visualise all kinds of graphs and figures and handles all the internal drawing logic for you. 

The matplotlib part of this workshop is an assisted guide through [the object orientated matplot lib available on their site](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/lifecycle.html#)

## Post Workshop submission

This workshop is the first workshop that includes a post workshop submission.

A post workshop submission is basically "Homework', the concept here is that the workshop attendees can try their own hand at a specified project with a defined outcome and then submit that to get feedback and advice on their work.

This Workshop submission takes the form of a Timetracker, I use a timetracker in my daily work life for client billing purposes as well as for my personal development as having a record of what I did and how long it took is very motivating to myself.

I built my own timetracker after seeing how developers I admire has benefited from their own. Two specifically were of inspiration to me: 
  
- Josh Avanier https://avanier.now.sh/w/log.html
- Devine Lu Linvega https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/horaire.html

What a TimeTracker involves are a few basic elements 
- A way to input when (how long or between what times) you did something
- A way to input what you did
- A way to store that data
- A way to visualise that data 
- A series of calculations your perform to draw your own conclusions based on this data

These basic elements ideally line up with what we have convered so far as well as allows you the attendee a series of options to go about it.

For this submission you can go about it any way you like using any of the techniques we have covered or havn't yet covered, you are encouraged to try new things and ask questions if you get stuck.

You submit your submissions by uploading your code to your Github account and then either informing your GirlCode person of contact or contacting me directly at hammanandre@gmail.com or on twitter [@Hamman_Andre](https://twitter.com/Hamman_Andre) I will then review your code for you and give you feedback.

The feedback will consist on commentary and advice on the way you went about it and suggestions on how you could have alternatively have done it, if necessary.
