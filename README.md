# GirlCode Python

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor of some kind, any will do. ([VSCode is cool](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VSCode is cool"))


## Workshop 1
- [Workshop](https://github.com/hammanandre/GirlCode_Python_One/blob/master/Workshop1.md)  This workshop takes inspiration from: https://www.thinkful.com/learn/intro-to-python-tutorial
### Goal
The workshop hopes to serve as an introduction to the basics of Python in a beginner friendly fashion that illustrates how to create the basic data structures available in Python as well as how to interact with them. This workshop also shows how to save these data structures to a local file and interact with a Python application using command line commands. 


The end product of this workshop is a basic code toy similar to a tamagotchi program.


The “player” will have a “virtual creature” expressed in data that is saved to a local file and they can type basic commands to the application to interact with these data structures and generates a result that in turn gets updated in the local storage file.
